    <p>Keda Reda is an Egyptian romantic comedy film starring Ahmed Helmy, Menna Shalabi. It has a very simple story <b
            style="color: black;">about 3 identical triplets.</b></p>
    <h1>the 3 identical triplets are:</h1>
    <h2>1.semsem (the introvert):</h2>
    <img src="./5b27e739b4057.jpg" alt="semsem" id="semsem">
    <p>Semsem is a quirky, energetic character who brings a lot of comedic moments to the series. He is known for his
        fun-loving and eccentric personality Though Semsem may not always be the most intelligent or rational character,
        his charm and antics add to the show’s lighthearted tone. His interactions with the main characters, especially
        Reda, often highlight the contrast between his more carefree nature and the chaos Reda finds himself in.</p>
    <h2>2.Bibo (a soccer fan)</h2>
    <img src="./MV5BY2UwZDI5OTgtMDEzMC00MDIyLTg2Y2UtZmFhOTdjZTdmYWUwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" alt="bibo" id="bibo">
    <p>Bibo's character is depicted as highly energetic, often obsessed with everything related to his favorite soccer
        team. His obsession with the sport leads him into some very funny and exaggerated situations. He’s the kind of
        character who can turn any conversation into a discussion about soccer, even when it's completely unrelated to
        the topic at hand. His dedication to the game and his team makes him a comedic figure, often clashing with the
        more grounded or logical characters around him, like his brother Semsem and others.</p>
    <h2>3.Prince (a 1900s clothes and action fan)</h2>
    <img src="./396157_0.jpg" alt="prince" id="Prince">
    <p>Prince is a man who sees himself as someone special, often speaking and acting in a way that reflects his
        inflated sense of importance. His character provides both humor and chaos in the show, with his overconfidence
        leading to a variety of absurd situations. Whether he's giving grand speeches about his supposed greatness or
        diving headfirst into strange plans, Prince adds a unique layer of comedy to the series.
        Despite his exaggerated sense of self, Prince is also a likable character who forms connections with the other
        main characters in the show, especially Reda and his family. He’s often part of the crazy adventures or mishaps
        that unfold, and his self-importance and sometimes outlandish behavior serve as a source of humor.</p>
    <h1>The trio, all named Reda all compete to win the heart of one beautiful girl:</h1>
    <h2>nada:</h2>
    <img src="./nada.jpg" alt="nada" id="nada">
    <p>nada is as a charming, attractive woman who is caught in a love triangle between semsem and his two brothers,
        prince and Bibo Her interactions with semsem and the brothers, especially the rivalry that develops due to their
        affection for her, create some comedic tension</p>
